# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1. 05.12.2022

Decided to start today. Why loosing time? No excuse for that.
Maily Python for the Code-Challenge. Sometimes also other projects and stuff for data. We will see how things will develop. Also creating a Portfolio-Website is ongoing. Just waiting for the transfer to the domain. 


**Today's Progress**: Starting
So: forked the repo, imported it to VSCode. Also a very nice practice of GitHub.
Now going on with Python.

I use this a source / guide: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc

Working on with my own version of Rock, Paper, Scissors Game for Two Players (my kids)

You can find it over in the other repo.
Today I started the main game loop - the selection of the number of rounds to be played (3, 5 or 7) which comes before needs also a loop to accept only one of these three numbers. 
So the main game loop starts with the display of the actual results of the players (wins, losses and ties). After that comes the first game. But I think I need a bed and will go on on Day 2. Night is short. 


**Thought**:
How will I do that, staying committed? I dont' know yet. So please hold me "responsible".
Social pressure and so on ;)

I started the Rock Paper Scissor Game a few days ago. Now coming back to it is a bit strange. Have to pick up the flow again. But luckily I started to try to make a lot with commenting. Should anyone read this, please, it would be nice to have a bit of a feedback upon the comments of the code. More or less, more in detail .. something like that. 

See you tomorrow! :)
