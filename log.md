# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day Zero. 05.12.2022

Decided to start today. Why loosing time? No excuse for that.

**Today's Progress**: Starting
So: forked the repo, imported it to VSCode. Also a very nice practice of GitHub.
Now going on with Python.

I use this a source / guide: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc

Working on with my own version of Rock, Paper, Scissors Game for Two Players (my kids)

**Thought**:
How will I do that . staying committed? I dont' know yet. So please hold me "responsible".
Social pressure and so on ;)
